This document describes how to install the MATLAB Common Runtime (MCR). This 
release of the MCR supports Windows (XP, 2000), and Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.
All applications developed with the MATLAB Compiler require the MCR to run. The
MCR must, therefore, be installed on every target machine. 

On windows, the self-extracting file MCRInstaller.exe is used install the MCR 
(simply follow the on-line instructions). The current installer on UNIX consists 
of a .ZIP file that contains all the shared libraries and other code that you 
will need to run applications built with the MATLAB Compiler. You can find the 
MCR installer files in toolbox/compiler/deploy/win32/MCRInstaller.exe and 
toolbox/compiler/deploy/glnx86/MCRInstaller.zip.

To install the MCR on UNIX, extract all the files from the ZIP archive into a 
new directory. (You've probably at least opened the ZIP file, or you wouldn't be 
reading these directions.) Let's call the installation directory MCR_ROOT. 
Simply replace <MCR_ROOT> in the following directions with the actual 
installation path.

Windows:

* The MCR Installer sets up the path automatically.

Linux:

*	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH  
               <MCR_ROOT>/bin/glnx86:
               <MCR_ROOT>/sys/os/glnx86:
               <MCR_ROOT>/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.4.2/lib/i386/client:
               <MCR_ROOT>/sys/java/jre/glnx86/jre1.4.2/lib/i386:
               <MCR_ROOT>/sys/opengl/lib/glnx86:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

*	setenv XAPPLRESDIR <MCR_ROOT>/X11/app-defaults
