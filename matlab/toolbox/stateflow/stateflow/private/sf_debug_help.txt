This is the help text for the Embedded MATLAB/Stateflow command line debugger.
To access the MATLAB help command, type "eval('help <cmd>')"

The following commands are overridden by the Embedded MATLAB/Stateflow command line debugger:

  help             Display this help text.
  dbstep [in|out]  Step over or step into/out of an Embedded MATLAB function.
  dbcont           Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
  dbquit           Quit debugging and terminate simulation.
  ctrl-c           Equivalent to dbquit.
  who              List the variables in the current workspace.
  whos             List details for the variables in the current workspace.
  print <var>      Print the value of a variable in the current workspace.
  <var>            Equivalent to "print <var>" if variable is in the current workspace.
  save             Save variables in the current workspace to disk.

Most MATLAB commands are supported at the debugger prompt. For example:
  plot(<var>)  plot variable <var>.
  edit foo.m   edit file "foo.m".
  <var>(2)     show the second element of variable <var>.

Modifying program variables has no effect. For example the line
   <var>(2) = 5;
will not modify the value of <var> when simulation continues.
