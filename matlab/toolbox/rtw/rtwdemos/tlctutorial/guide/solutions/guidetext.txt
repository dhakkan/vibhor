Using TLC you can:
* Directly access any field's value, e.g.
  %<Top.Date> -- evaluates to:
  "21-Aug-2008"

* Assign contents of a field to a variable, e.g.
  "%assign worker = Top.Employee.FirstName"
  worker expands to Top.Employee.FirstName = Arthur

* Concatenate string values, e.g.
  "%assign worker = worker + " " + Top.Employee.LastName"
  worker expands to worker + " " + Top.Employee.LastName = "Arthur Dent"
  
* Perform arithmetic operations, e.g.
  "%assign wageCost = Top.Employee.PayRate * Top.Employee.Overhead"
  wageCost expands to Top.Employee.PayRate * Top.Employee.Overhead <- 11.5 * 1.78 = 20.47
  
* Put variables into a field, e.g.
  "%assign Top.Employee.GrossRate = wageCost"
  Top.Employee.GrossRate expands to wageCost = 20.47

* Index lists of values, e.g.
  "%assign projects = Top.Project[0].Name + ", " + Top.Project[1].Name..."
  "+ ", " + Top.Project[2].Name"
  projects expands to Top.Project[0].Name + ", " + Top.Project[1].Name
  + ", " + Top.Project[2].Name = Tea, Gillian, Zaphod

* Traverse and manipulate list data via loops, e.g.
  - At top of Loop, Project = Tea; Difficulty = 3
  - Bottom of Loop, i = 0; diffSum = 3.0
  - At top of Loop, Project = Gillian; Difficulty = 8
  - Bottom of Loop, i = 1; diffSum = 11.0
  - At top of Loop, Project = Zaphod; Difficulty = 10
  - Bottom of Loop, i = 2; diffSum = 21.0
  Average Project Difficulty expands to diffSum / Top.NumProject = 21.0 / 3 = 7.0
