1. Most people want to earn more than 30 LPA . This reason for this is justified through other findings . Albeit more than 60% of student's parents annual income is more than 8.4 LPA , but 58% of students have loan . It means that to live a loan free life , they should earn more than 10-20 LPA and thus for luxurious life 30 LpA is not too much .

2.Although most of the students need a large amount of salary , but they are generally frugal in nature . About 60% of the student's household income is > 70k per month and only 29% students want more than 3.5k per month for their college expense.

3.But even then , above result can be contradicted . Students might need a small portion of their parent's salary for their expense . But most of the money is spent on restaurents(89%),outings(40%) and movies(44%) , and these all are non-necessary expense.

4.About 71% of the students consider salary and perks to be important but only 17% work hard for this things .

5.About 62% students are not interested  in the process which may lead them to their career related goal . They are doing it for the sake of goal.

6.So concatinating all the things , students are internally frugal but they want more money , and most of them are not even interested in their career goal.This result is enough to show the omnipresent "peer pressure".
