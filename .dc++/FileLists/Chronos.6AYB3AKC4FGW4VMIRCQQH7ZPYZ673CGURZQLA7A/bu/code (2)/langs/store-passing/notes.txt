Store-passing interpreter  with explicit references.

[Corresponds to exercise 4.12 of EOPL]

Changes to AST:
---------------

* new-ref
* deref
* setref


changes to semantic-domains:
-----------------------------
add void to expressible values
add ref(expressible-value) to expressible-value

denotable-values = expressible-values
storable-values = expressible-values

earlier env-rec.ss folded into semantic-domains.ss, because
environments and semantic-domains are mutually recursive.
This refactoring should be done in the RECURSION language
implementation as well.


changes to eval-ast
-------------------

* signature of eval-ast

* eval-asts

* signature of eval-closure

* semantic checks when store operations are performed.
